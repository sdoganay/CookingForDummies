# CookingForDummies
Project.

This is a recipe app we've built for our Android class in OzU.
You can search different recipes by ingredients.
This app also solves a UX problem: you can use it without touching the screen. 
While following the recipe, you may ask to repeat the step, go for the next step or for the previous step.
For voice libraries, Google was chosen.
